# NN_ICP5

Here, in this first question, I have implemented naïve bayes method using scikit 
learn library using the glass dataset provided. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part. 
By using Naïve bayes classifier , and by using 0.2 as test_size. Then I evaluated the part 
On test part using score. I got 55% accuracy. 


Here, in this Second question, I have implemented SVM method using scikit learn 
library using the glass dataset provided. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part. 
By using Naïve bayes classifier , and by using 0.2 as test_size. Then I evaluated the part 
On test part using score. I got 51% accuracy. 


Here I got better accuracy with NB than SVM, as we tested the model with score parameter and NB is 
very fast and SVM works better with non linear data and multi dimensional. 
But we can’t say which classifier works better than which classifier comparatively. As it depends on the 
data we took and the parameter we taken for the testing part, But in here used same data and same 
parameter still NB got higher accuracy than SVM. But may be due to the linearity of the data.
